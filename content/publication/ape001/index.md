  This technical report presents the complete symbolic modeling and dynamic analysis of a custom-designed SCARA robot with five degrees of freedom. The project includes the development of forward and inverse kinematics, Jacobian matrices, singularity analysis, and Lagrangian dynamics under realistic motion profiles. MATLAB and Python scripts are provided for symbolic computation and numerical evaluation, while ROS2 integration supports simulation and motion planning.

summary: Symbolic and numerical dynamic modeling of a SCARA robot with ROS2 and MATLAB integration.
