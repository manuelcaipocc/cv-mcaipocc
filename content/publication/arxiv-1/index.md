abstract: Combining the agility of legged locomotion with the capabilities of manipulation, loco-manipulation platforms have the potential to perform complex tasks in real-world applications. To this end, state-of-the-art quadrupeds with attached manipulators, such as the Boston Dynamics Spot, have emerged to provide a capable and robust platform. However, both the complexity of loco-manipulation control, as well as the black-box nature of commercial platforms pose challenges for developing accurate dynamics models and control policies. We address these challenges by developing a hand-crafted kinematic model for a quadruped-with-arm platform and, together with recent advances in Bayesian Neural Network (BNN)-based dynamics learning using physical priors, efficiently learn an accurate dynamics model from data. We then derive control policies for loco-manipulation via model-based reinforcement learning (RL). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on hardware using the Boston Dynamics Spot with a manipulator, accurately performing dynamic end-effector trajectory tracking even in low data regimes.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this work, we propose a BNN-based dynamics learning method using physical priors for efficient policy learning.
