abstract: >
  This thesis presents the mechanical and structural design of a 350 TPH copper concentrate feeding conveyor belt system, integrating an automated hydraulic tensioning mechanism and a receiving hopper. The design methodology adheres to standards such as the CEMA and AISC, addressing variability in design practices across the mining sector. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used for the mechanical evaluation of belt components and structural elements. A significant time reduction of up to 90% was achieved by employing design software tools. The hydraulic scheme developed enables horizontal and vertical tensioning and may serve as a generalized solution for different conveyor layouts. The analysis highlights critical design aspects such as internal friction angle, dynamic pressures on the hopper, fatigue stresses on pulleys, and appropriate sealing geometries. This work contributes to standardized, efficient, and robust conveyor system designs for mineral transport applications.
