#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am currently a doctoral fellow advised by [Prof. Marco Hutter](https://mavt.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.hutter.html) and [Prof. Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea) at [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/), Switzerland. Before that, I received my master's degree in [Robotics, Systems and Control](https://ethz.ch/en/studies/master/degree-programmes/engineering-sciences/robotics-systems-and-control.html) from [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) and my bachelor’s degree from [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/).

During my master studies, I worked on structured motion representation and active learning methods at the [Biomimetic Robotics Lab](https://biomimetics.mit.edu/) at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://www.mit.edu/) with [Prof. Sangbae Kim](https://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/SANGBAE@MIT.EDU). Prior to that, I was engaged in agile motion imitation from limited demonstrations and intrinsic skill exploration with [Prof. Georg Martius](https://al.is.mpg.de/person/gmartius) at the [Autonomous Learning Group](https://al.is.mpg.de/) at [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (MPI-IS)](https://is.mpg.de/), Tübingen, Germany.

My research interests focus on algorithms that can enable autonomous agents to acquire complex behaviors through learning, especially general-purpose methods that could enable any autonomous system to learn to solve any task. On legged robots particularly, I am thrilled to apply these techniques to achieve animal-level agility and naturalness.
