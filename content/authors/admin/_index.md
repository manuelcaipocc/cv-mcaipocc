#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I’m a Data Scientist and Mechanical Engineer, currently pursuing a Master’s degree in [Advanced Precision Engineering](https://www.hs-furtwangen.de/studiengang/advanced-precision-engineering-master/) at [Hochschule Furtwangen](https://www.hs-furtwangen.de/) in Germany.

Alongside my academic journey, I work at [Bosch Rexroth](https://www.boschrexroth.com/), where I design and implement **Docker-based ETL pipelines** and **real-time monitoring systems** for hydraulic systems. My role focuses on connecting physical systems with intelligent software solutions, contributing to the future of industrial automation.

My story begins in Peru, where I graduated top of my class in Mechanical Engineering from the [Universidad Nacional de San Agustín de Arequipa (UNSA)](https://www.unsa.edu.pe/). My academic excellence earned me the prestigious [Beca Presidente del Perú](https://www.pronabec.gob.pe/concursos-becas-creditos/), a national scholarship awarded to students with the highest performance in the country.

Later, I was selected as one of 100 finalists out of 16,000 applicants to join [Freeport-McMoRan](https://www.fcx.com/), where I applied **Machine Learning** for **predictive maintenance (Remaining Useful Life)** across global mining operations—combining data science with high-stakes, real-world engineering.

My work bridges engineering and intelligent systems, with a strong emphasis on practical implementation and scalable solutions. I specialize in:

- **Machine Learning & Time-Series Modeling**  
  Predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and signal analysis using Python, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.

- **Dockerized ETL Pipelines & Cloud Integration**  
  Modular, real-time data pipelines built with Dagster, orchestrated in Docker, and deployed on cloud platforms like Azure.

- **Industrial Communication & Monitoring (OPC UA)**  
  Design and implementation of robust monitoring architectures using OPC UA for data acquisition in manufacturing systems.

- **Technology Stack**  
  Python, PostgreSQL, Power BI/Grafana, Git, Azure ML — integrated into reliable and reproducible workflows.


I aim to pursue a Ph.D. in Robotics, Control Systems, or Industrial AI, developing impactful technologies that bridge data and physical systems.
